Week Of April 11, 2016
We have established the link to a database, and have moved forward with the manner in which we can post the data that is collected by the user. We have taken that data, and are logging it to the needed DB, through some post requests to the server, and accepting that data and moving forward from there. 
We have normalized the data that is presented to the DB, logging the time of the event, the latitude, and the longitude of the sound that is being collected. 
The connection to the database is throgh the post command, that is available in jave, to which we are sending out the given database. 
The Website side is going to log the data that is in the database directly, and move forward from there. 
Logging the data from the given database is not going to be too difficult of a turn forward. 

(Not too sure of what else needs to be displayed for the README. Moving forward )
